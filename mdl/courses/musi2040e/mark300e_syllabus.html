              <td>100 Points</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Each module's assignment(s) will be due on the Friday that the module ends by 11 am EST. Please note on the schedule the Introduction Module Assignment is due by Friday, June 10 at 11 am EST. The course is organized into 7 different modules along with an Introduction module. There are assignments due within most modules, as noted on the syllabus. No late assignments will be accepted, no exceptions. Module 6 requires the completion of two modules within the Management by the Numbers software. See further details below.</p>
          <p>With the exception of Module 6, each assignment that is to be turned in is to adhere to the following guidelines. Deductions will be made if these guidelines are not followed.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The format to be turned in should be a Word.doc file.</li>
            <li>The assignment should be no more than 2 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt. font.</li>
            <li>The document should be professionally written in the style of a formal memo to a manager at your workplace. Please refer to Purdue's Online Writing Lab (OWL) for instructions (<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/590/03/">Link</a>) and a sample (<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/590/04/">Link</a>) of the style.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The four exams will each be released based on the schedule below. Exams will be open book, timed, and will cover the text, assigned readings, and all material covered in class including lectures, cases, and guest presentations. Exams may include both objective (multiple choice, true/false) and open-ended (short answer) questions. Once you begin the exam, you will have 50 minutes to complete the exam and submit. You will not be able to pause and log back into the exam hence, you will need to select an uninterrupted 50 minute time block to complete and submit the exam in the allocated time period. There are no make-up exams. If you miss an exam, that exam will count as a zero. You may not consult fellow students, outside resources, or share any information related to the exam until all exam scores are released. Any violation of this policy constitutes academic dishonesty, and the procedures, as noted below, will be pursued.</p>

          <h2>Management by the Numbers Exercises</h2>
          <p>You must complete the two modules listed below. The time required to complete each module will vary depending on your background experience and comfort level with quantitative analyses. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to begin working on the first tutorial as early as possible. You will need to familiarize yourself with the content by viewing and possibly taking notes on the tutorial, prior to beginning each problem set. Before getting started, you will need to go through the &ldquo;Intro&rdquo; tutorial (a flash presentation). It will help you get acquainted with the format of the questions and how to submit your answers before you begin the actual problem sets.</p>

          <p>There are four problem sets for each module. Each problem set consists of 4-8 questions based on a realistic business situation. You will have two opportunities to answer each question correctly before advancing. After you have attempted to answer all the questions for a particular problem set, you will move to the next problem set with a new business situation. Generally, you will find the first questions in a problem set less complex so that you can build toward more difficult questions at the end of the problem set.</p>
          
          <p>Completion of a problem set means that you have answered all the questions correctly in a row ('mastery'). Once you have completed four problem sets, you have completed that module. The average of your scores on the two modules will be your assignment score for Module 6.</p>

All academic work must meet the standards described in &ldquo;A Culture of Honesty&rdquo; found at: <a href="http://www.uga.edu/honesty">www.uga.edu/honesty</a>.
