            <h2>Introduction to American Indian Music Traditions</h2>
              <p>
                The study of American Indian music requires us to understand a complex history of destruction and dispossession. At the same time, it offers us a chance to consider some remarkable examples of cultural survival and renewal. Although we do not have enough breadth and depth if coverage to make broad generalizations about this history, each of our three listening selections does offer us an insight into the history and culture of a single tribe. We will take them one by one.

                <span class="emphasis">Streaming audio/mp3.</span> “Pigeon's Dream Song,” sung by Louis Pigeon. Menominee, Northern Wisconsin, ca. 1929. Recorded by Frances Densmore (1867-1957). This song is a remarkable example of cultural survival. Louis Pigeon was a member of the Menominee tribe. Densmore was a visionary pioneer in the work of preserving American Indian music. Densmore tells us that Louis Pigeon was a healer; he used his songs and also herbal remedies to treat illnesses.

                <span class="emphasis">Early history.</span> The Menominee are the only present-day tribe in Wisconsin whose origin story indicates they have always lived in Wisconsin. The Menominee lived around Green Bay when the French explorer Jean Nicolet arrived there in 1634. Prior to the coming of the French, the Menominee settled in village sites at the mouth of the Menominee River. Their main village, called Menekaunee, was located near present-day Marinette, Wisconsin.

                <span class="emphasis">Modern history.</span> At the start of the Treaty Era in the early 1800’s, the Menominee occupied a land base estimated at 10 million acres; however, through a series of seven treaties entered into with the United States Government during the 1800s, the Tribe witnessed its land base erode to little more than 235,000 acres today. The Tribe experienced further setbacks in the 1950’s with the U.S. Congress’ passage of the Menominee Termination Act, which removed federal recognition over the Tribe and threatened to deprive Menominee people of their cultural identity. Fortunately, the Tribe won back its federal recognition in 1973 through a long and difficult grassroots movement that culminated with the passage of the Menominee Restoration Act, Public Law 93-197, on December 22, 1973.

In the traditional history of Ohkay Owingeh (“Place of the Strong People”) the ancestors are said to have emerged from a lake in the north, hence a sipapu or place of emergence from the under world. The Tewa people traveled south making settlements on both sides of the Rio Grande, and at the site of Ohkay Owingeh they built two villages one on each side of the river, probably about 1200 A.D.

                <span class="emphasis">Modern History.</span> In 1820 during the last months of the Spanish government, the Pueblo Indians were given full citizenship and were allowed to install their own municipal governments in each Pueblo. This prerogative was honored in the period of Mexican rule, 1821 to 1846, and in the American period from 1846 to the 1870s. The alienation of Pueblo lands was achieved through the courts; Pueblo lands were allowed to be sold by a U. S. Supreme Court ruling in 1876, but in 1913, the Court reversed this ruling, stating that the Pueblo lands had to be protected in the same manner as other Indian lands. The United States Pueblo Lands Board Act was passed in 1924. The Pueblo Lands Board Act made it very difficult for outsiders to gain title to Pueblo lands and served to extinguish many of the land claims against the Pueblos.

                With the settling of land issues, improvements in health and education, the people of Ohkay Owingeh gradually entered the economy and way of life of twentieth-century America. They were able to do this and still maintain their traditional culture and worldview. Their ability to live comfortably in both worlds continues to the present day. In December 2005 the tribal council formally changed the name from San Juan Pueblo back to Ohkay Owingeh, the name by which the people themselves have always called their home from long before Europeans came to the Southwest.

                <span class="emphasis">Modern History.</span> Over the course of the nineteenth century, the Pawnee people were subjected to an incessant, ever-increasing interplay of destructive forces that radically changed their lives, the result of the rapidly increasing influences of an expansionist United States. Finally, in 1874 the tribe began a two-year removal to Indian Territory [i.e. Oklahoma], where the Pawnee began new lives. In 1891 the majority of the tribe adopted the ghost dance when it spread among Plains tribes, promising a return to their former way of life before the advent of whites. The ghost dance also served as a stimulus for the revival of many features of traditional Pawnee culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the first three decades of their new residence in Indian Territory, the Pawnee people experienced poor health, coupled with inadequate sanitation and health care. As a result, the population reached a record low of 629 individuals in 1901. Beginning in 1906 the Pawnee no longer had a tribal government, and they remained unorganized politically during the first three decades of the twentieth century. In the 1930s the situation changed when the Indian Reorganization Act and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act ushered in a nonassimilationist program that sought to give tribes legal status and economic resources to continue their existence. In 1937 Pawnee leaders began a three- decade-long effort to regain the Pawnee Reserve lands. Ownership was returned to the tribe in 1968. In 1980 a tribal roundhouse, modeled on the traditional Pawnee earth lodge, was built to serve as a social center for dances and other events. These acquisitions have provided the Pawnee Tribe, today the Pawnee Nation, with both a physical and symbolic locus for tribal administration and social identity.

Think about interaction and instruments. Even though this music is performed by different people groups, are there ways that they’re performing similar functions?
