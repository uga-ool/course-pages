<h2>How to Communicate in this Class</h2>
<p>Put your Netiquette policy here. A sample one is included as a recommendation.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following guidelines should be followed each time you interact in the course to insure your interactions are respectful and professional:</p>
<ol>
<li>In all your interactions, remember that there is a person behind the written post, who has feelings and can be hurt by what and how you interact with him or her.</li>
<li>It is easier to say something online when you do not have to look the person in the eye, so never post anything that you would not say to the person face-to-face.</li>
<li>Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life, which includes acting ethically and following rules and regulations. If you would not steal in real life, then you should not steal online by taking other peopleâ€™s ideas and using them as your own.</li>
<li>Respect other people&rsquo;s time and bandwidth: a) Take time to understand the requirements of the discussion. b) Do not waste people&rsquo;s time by asking questions that are not relevant to the discussion or questions whose answers can be readily be found in the course with a little effort. c) Refrain from disagreements that lead to personal attacks.</li>
<li>Make yourself look good online: a) Take time to check your spelling and grammar. b) Prepare for discussions prior to engaging in them. c) Refrain from inappropriate language and remarks.</li>
<li>Share your knowledge by offering help to learners who have questions.</li>
<li>Help keep flame wars under control by not posting flames and not responding to flames &ndash; keep discussions professional.</li>
<li>Forgive other learners&rsquo; mistakes and be patient and compassionate of all learners in the course.</li>
